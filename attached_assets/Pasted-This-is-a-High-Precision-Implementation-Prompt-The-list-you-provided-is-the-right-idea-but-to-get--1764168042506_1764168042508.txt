This is a High-Precision Implementation Prompt. The list you provided is the right idea, but to get Replit to execute it perfectly in one go without errors, we need to bundle these tasks into a single, cohesive set of instructions that handles Data, UI, and Routing simultaneously.

Copy and paste this entire block into your Replit Agent. It organizes your 6 points into a logical workflow that prevents "undefined" errors.

<project_context>
**Goal:** Implement the "Technician Directory" and "Profile Details" features to match the high-fidelity designs.
**Current State:** The app lacks specific fields (Pro/Promo status), the card design is generic, and clicking a profile does nothing.
**Visual Style:** "Moroccan Professional" (Blue #1e40af / Orange #ea580c).
</project_context>

<task_instructions>
Execute the following 4-step plan to upgrade the Technician experience.

**STEP 1: DATA LAYER UPGRADE (Add Type & Status)**
Update `src/lib/mockData.ts` (or your data source) to match this exact interface. You must add the new boolean flags for badges:
```typescript
export interface Technician {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string; // e.g., "Plumber", "Electrician"
  rating: number;
  reviews: number;
  location: string; // e.g., "Casablanca"
  price: number; // Hourly rate in MAD
  image: string;
  tags: string[]; // e.g., ["Fuites", "Débouchage"]
  isPro: boolean; // NEW: Triggers the Green "PRO" badge
  isPromo: boolean; // NEW: Triggers the Red "Promo" badge
  availability: "Immédiat" | "Sur RDV"; // NEW: Status field
  bio?: string;
  phone?: string;
  email?: string;
  experience?: string;
  certifications?: string[];
}
Action: Update the existing sample data (Youssef, Karim, Fatima) to include these new fields.

STEP 2: REDESIGN TECHNICIAN CARD (TechnicianCard.tsx) Refactor the card component to match the "cc.png" design:

Image: Top half, object-cover, h-48.

Badges: Use absolute positioning (absolute top-2 right-2 flex gap-2) to show:

PRO Badge: Green background (bg-green-500), white text, rounded-full.

Promo Badge: Red background (bg-red-500), white text, tag shape.

Price & Availability: Display price (150 MAD / heure) on the left and availability badge (border-green-500 text-green-600) on the right.

Action: The "Réserver" button must be full-width, dark blue (bg-slate-900), and navigate to the detail page.

STEP 3: CREATE PROFILE PAGE (src/pages/TechnicianProfile.tsx) Build a new page that displays the full details of a technician:

Layout: Use a 2-column grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3).

Left Column (Sidebar): Large Avatar, Name, Rating, Big "Réserver" Button.

Right Column (Content): Bio ("À propos"), Info Grid (Phone/Email), Specialties Tags, Certifications list.

Navigation: Add a "← Retour aux artisans" link at the top.

STEP 4: ROUTING & AI FEATURE

Router: In src/App.tsx, import the new page and add the route: <Route path="/technician/:id" element={<TechnicianProfile />} />

AI Button: In your BookingModal or BookingForm component:

Locate the "Description" textarea.

Add a small button inside or below it: "✨ Améliorer avec IA".

Logic: For now, just make it clickable (console.log "AI Triggered").

### **Why this prompt works better:**
1.  **Data First:** It defines the *Interface* first. If you just ask to "add fields," the AI might name them `status` vs `availability` or `type` vs `isPro`, causing errors in your components.
2.  **Visual Specificity:** It explicitly tells the AI to use `absolute top-2 right-2` for the badges. Without this, the AI will stack them normally, breaking the design you wanted from the screenshot.
3.  **Routing Logic:** It explicitly pairs the *creation* of the page with the *connection* of the route (`App.tsx`). Replit often forgets to connect the route if you don't ask.
